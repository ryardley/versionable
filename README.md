# Versionable

An event driven memory efficient version control data container.

This is a work in progress and not ready for use quite yet (eta March 2020).

## Why?

I needed a way to branch from history of user actions and for users to go back to any state in the app and build up new history branches. I also needed to serialize the data and send it to the server in the most efficient way possible.
